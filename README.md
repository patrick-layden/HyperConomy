HyperConomy
===========

HyperConomy is the all in one economy and shop plugin.  It can be a simple chest or sign shop plugin, a Vault compatible economy plugin, a region based shop plugin with many configurable options, or even a complex system of economically competing towns and kingdoms.  Any vanilla Minecraft item can be traded in HyperConomy and virtually any custom item can be added as well.  Prices can be configured to change dynamically or they can be set as desired.  To quickly edit prices and settings you can double click on HyperConomy.jar to access the GUI editor.  HyperConomy has many features including things such as item price linking and showcase style item displays.  Read below or check out the wiki for more information.

* Recommended builds are marked with [RB] and are generally thought to be stable and bug free.
* Builds marked as [Beta] are as bug free as possible, but often have large code changes which may result in the appearance of new bugs.
* Builds marked as [Dev] are development builds.  Development builds may contain bugs as I work on releasing a new [Beta] build. They may also contain fixes for bugs found in [Beta] builds. Use these builds if you're looking for a bug fix, or would like to try out a new feature I've just added. Also, feel free to search for bugs in the development builds.
